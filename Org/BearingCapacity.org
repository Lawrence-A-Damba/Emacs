* Bearing Capacity of Soils
** Chapter 1 Introduction
*** Purpose and Scope
**** Calculation of the Bearing Capacity of soil under shallow and deep foundations, generally applicable to the Corps. Consideration should be given to obtaining the services and advice of specialists and consultants in foundation design where foundation conditions are unusual or critical or steructures are economically significant.
